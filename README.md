### Development: Get Started

_**It is highly recommended to use Microsoft Edge Tools for VS Code AND\
Debugger for Microsoft Edge**_

1. Run `Start Dev Env` task in VS Code

- You'll want to close the browser window that opens up if one does.

2. F5 to start debugging

- This will open a new window that's attached to the VS Code debugger

3. Start developing!
